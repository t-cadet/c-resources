 get_syscall_tables.c
+---------------------
| A script to retrieve syscall numbers for relevant architectures & generate a unified syscall table.
|
| Storytelling:
|   By a twist of fate, Linux has been plagued by a curse that has prevented it from developing a C API for its own syscalls!
|
| (*crowd laments* Oh, sorrow! How malevolent, how monstrous!)
|
| This leaves us, user-land programmers, with a choice:
|
| * to carry on the heavy burden of our fathers, and their fathers before them, and depend on the venerable lib-lega-c
| (*crowd jeers* No! Boo!)
| * or to muster our courage, and cobble together a syscall API. Flaky as it may be at first, we will proudly call it our own!
|
| It is with great relief that we choose to cobble! Freeing ourselves from the hairy lib-lega-c, and
| reaching ever further towards the platform's true programming Ground!
|
| (*crowd cheers* Woooooooh!)
|
| It has been said that the user-land that lies beyond lib-lega-c is not the promised user-land.
| Nonsense! That is not so.
|
| O adventurous programmers! Let there be no fear of broken formats, scattered data or compatibility hell!
| We shall prevail!
|
| (*crowd cheers* Woooooooh!)
